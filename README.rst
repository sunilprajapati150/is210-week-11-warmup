Overview
========

In this assignment, you'll be introduced to Python's classes and use them
in isolated contexts to get a feel for how they work.

Instructions
============

The following tasks will either have you interacting with existing files in
the assignment repository or creating new ones on the fly. Don't forget to add
your interpreter directive, utf-8 encoding, and a short docstring with any new
files that you create!

.. important::

    In these exercises, you may, on occasion, come across a task that requres
    you to research or use a function or method not directly covered by the
    course text. Since Python is such a large language it would be impossible
    for the author to have included descriptions of each and every available
    function which would largely duplicate the offical Python documentation.

    A *vital* skill to successful programming is being comfortable searching
    for and using official language documentation sources like the
    `Python String Documentation`_ page. Throughout our coursework we will be
    practicing both the use of the language in practice and the search skills
    necessary to become functional programmers.

Warmup Tasks
============

Task 01
-------

You've already instantiated and used some classes already if you consider
your prior use of such classes like the ``Decimal()`` class. Here you'll be
instantiating and accessing custom class instances.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a new module named ``task_01.py``. In ``task_01.py``:

#.  Import the ``produce`` module

#.  Create two instances of the ``Produce()`` class

    #.  The first should not be passed any constructor variables and should be
        assigned to a variable named ``TOMATO``

    #.  The next should be named ``EGGPLANT`` and the constructor should be
        passed the value of ``1311210802``

#.  Access the ``arrival`` attribute of ``TOMATO`` and save it to a variable
    named ``TOMATO_ARRIVAL``

#.  Call the ``get_expiration()`` method of ``EGGPLANT`` and save its result
    to a variable named, ``EGGPLANT_EXPIRES``

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> isinstance(TOMATO, produce.Produce)
    True
    >>> isinstance(EGGPLANT, produce.Produce)
    True

Task 02
-------

In this task you'll be creating your own class from the ground-up.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a new file named ``task_02.py``. In ``task_02.py``:

#.  Import the ``time`` module. This module provides functions specifically
    related to time. We'll use it for its ``time()`` function which returns a
    `Unix Timestamp`_ 

#.  Create a class named ``Snapshot``

#.  Create a constructor for ``Snapshot``

#.  In the constructor, create an *instance attribute* named ``created`` and
    assign it the output of ``time.time()`` which returns the current
    `Unix Timestamp`_

.. tip::

    Classes without an explicit parent class should always be subclassed to the
    generic ``object`` class.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> mysnap = Snapshot()
    >>> hasattr(mysnap, 'created')
    True

Task 03
-------

Subclasses are part of the heart and soul of object-oriented programming. Here,
we'll be subclassing an existing class to slightly alter its properties.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a new file named ``task_03.py``. In ``task_03.py``:

#.  Import the ``produce`` module

#.  Create a new class named ``Apple`` that is subclassed from
    ``produce.Produce``

#.  Update the *class attribute* named ``duration`` to a new value of
    ``5356800``

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> print Apple.duration
    5356800
    >>> print produce.Produce.duration
    604800

Task 04
-------

In this exercise, we'll be using subclassing, to demonstrate both the
*has-a* and *is-a* concepts. Take a peek inside the ``car`` module as we'll be
extending the ``Car()`` class found inside.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a new module named ``task_04.py``.

#.  Import the ``car`` module.

#.  Create a class named ``CustomCar()`` that is itself, a child-class of
    ``car.Car``

#.  Create a class named ``CustomTire()`` that is, itself, a child-class of
    ``car.Tire``

#.  Override the class constructor ``CustomCar()`` has inherited from ``Car()``
    and, in it, call the ``Car()`` constructor. To do this, you must call the
    ``car.Car()`` constructor as a *class method* and **not** as an *instance
    method*. A snippet containing this construction is as below:
    below:

    .. code:: python

        car.Car.__init__(self, color)

    This calls the constructor to do its work but *instead* of creating a new
    instance of ``car.Car()`` we pass it the current instance of
    ``CustomCar()`` as ``self``.

#.  Add an additional argument named, ``tires`` to the ``CustomCar()``
    constructor.

    #.  Generally, this should be a list of ``CustomTire()`` objects

    #.  The default of this argument should be ``None``

#.  Add a new *instance attribute* to ``CustomCar()`` called
    ``tires`` to store a list of tires

    #.  Assign the new instance attribute the value of the ``tires`` argument

    #.  If the value of the ``tires`` argument is ``None``:

        #.  Create a list

        #.  Create four new instances of the ``CustomTire()`` class and append
            each into the list

#.  Add a pseudo-private *class attribute* to the ``CustomTires()`` class
    called ``__maximum_miles`` and assign it a value of ``500``.

#.  Test that your ``CustomCar()`` class works with both a ``tires`` argument
    and without.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> mycar = CustomCar()
    >>> len(mycar.tires)
    4
    >>> isinstance(mycar.tires[0], CustomTire)
    True

Executing Tests
===============

Code must be functional and pass tests before it will be eligible for credit.

Linting
-------

Lint tests check your code for syntactic or stylistic errors To execute lint
tests against a specific file, simply open a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ pylint filename.py

Where ``filename.py`` is the name of the file you wish to lint test.

Unit Tests
----------

Unit tests check that your code performs the tested objectives. Unit tests
may be executed individually by opening a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and typing:

.. code:: console

    $ nosetests tests/name_of_test.py

Where ``name_of_test.py`` is the name of the testfile found in the ``tests``
directory of your source code.

Running All Tests
-----------------

All tests may be run simultaneously by executing the ``runtests.sh`` script
from the root of your assignment repository. To execute all tests, open a
terminal in the same directory as your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ bash runtests.sh

Submission
==========

Code should be submitted to `GitHub`_ by means of opening a pull request.

As-of Lesson 02, each student will have a branch named after his or her
`GitHub`_ username. Pull requests should be made against the branch that
matches your `GitHub`_ username. Pull requests made against other branches will
be closed.  This work flow mimics the steps you took to open a pull request
against the ``pull`` branch in Week Two.

For a refresher on how to open a pull request, please see homework instructions
in Lesson 01. It is recommended that you run PyLint locally after each file
is edited in order to reduce the number of errors found in testing.

In order to receive full credit you must complete the assignment as-instructed
and without any violations (reported in the build status). There will be
automated tests for this assignment to provide early feedback on program code.

When you have completed this assignment, please post the link to your
pull request in the body of the assignment on Blackboard in order to receive
credit.
